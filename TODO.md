# Bugs

- no sound on Mint 24?


# Features

- Create map editor


# Questions

- In previous verions of Outgun, bot ping coudld be set, and then bots added with that ping.
  The game could have bots of varying ping level. It appears that now all bots get the same
  ping based on the last /bot ping X command. Is this the case?

- Where is version number set? So we can increment version numbers as we make changes

- How are server generated maps created?


# Packaging

- Add AppImage release to GH

- Create Linux x86_64 release package for GH (make sure it bundles `config/`
  alongside the binaries — see the `gamemod.txt`/`auth.txt` note below)


# Done

- ~~Set default "Show player names" setting to Always~~

- ~~Update dead.pcx to splat graphic~~: `graphics/Grass/dead.pcx` and
  `dead_alpha.pcx` replaced.

- ~~Clean up default config~~: `autoGetServerList` ("Get server list at
  startup") now defaults to off (`src/client_menus.cpp`), but the deeper fix
  was in `MasterSettings::load()` (`src/commont.cpp`): it unconditionally did
  *synchronous DNS resolution* for the master/ranking/bug-report server
  names on every launch, completely independent of `autoGetServerList` or
  any other setting — that's what was actually causing the delay/timeout,
  not the list-fetch itself. The hard-coded defaults (`koti.mbnet.fi`,
  `outgun.com.br`, `nix.dnsalias.net` — all long dead) are now blank, so
  the length checks skip resolution entirely and startup is instant; point
  `whereuserdir/config/master.txt` at a real master server to opt back in.
  Also: bug report policy now defaults to disabled on the first-run splash;
  default "Rooms on screen in each direction in game" is 1; "Scrolling"
  defaults off; default theme is Grass, default background theme is Metal;
  "Show favorite servers" now defaults on (all `src/client_menus.cpp`).
- ~~gamemod.txt gets created only when running via outgun-ded~~ /
  ~~client GUI-launched server shows "Can't open game mod file"~~: the real
  bug was that `seedUserConfigFileIfMissing()` (`src/main.cpp`) seeds
  `whereuserdir/config/gamemod.txt` from the shipped
  `wheregamedir/config/gamemod.txt` template — which silently does nothing
  if that template isn't present (e.g. a minimal deployment that only ships
  the binary, without the `config/` directory). A missing gamemod.txt was
  already handled gracefully (server runs fine on built-in defaults), but
  `Server::SettingManager::loadGamemod()` (`src/server_settings.cpp`) logged
  it as an *error*, which surfaced in the scary "Errors:" summary shown at
  exit. Downgraded to a plain informational log line. Verified by running
  `outgun-ded`/`outgun` from a directory containing only the binary (+
  `maps/`, required regardless) — no more error, either at startup or exit.
- ~~Add config paths to readme~~: see "File locations" above.
